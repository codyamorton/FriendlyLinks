# FriendlyLinks
.Net N Tier Architectured MVC for Final Project with Eleven Fifty Academy
Friendly links allows golfers to purchase tee times from private golf courses which otherwise require a substantial amount of money to play. The MVC consists of 3 data tables (Tee times, Golfer, and golf course) which are built out with full CRUD. In order to view the controller output you must register via the register button. Once registeres you have the options to create new golf courses, golfers, and tee times. To view model information please utilize the navigation links in the header section. There is also a contact nav button which has the owners information for any questions, concerns, or feedback. The main landing page also consists of links to the usga, first tee of indiana, and a calendar that will eventually have all of the dates for outings, tournaments, and any events that Friendly Links is associated with. We hope you enjoy our application and always appreciate any feedback to help us better ourselves. Thank you for your visit and remember... Its all in the hips. :)
